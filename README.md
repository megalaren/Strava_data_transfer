# Strava_data_transfer
#### Transferring workouts from "*.gpx*", "*.tcx*", "*.json*" or "*.csv*" files to Strava.<br>

While transferring my workouts from Endomondo and Runkeeper to Strava, I am facing problems, so I decided to create my own program.  
To upload activities you need:
- Edit in accordance with your tasks, and separately run parsing_<type_of_file>.py to parse the files that need to be uploaded to the Strava.
- Get an access token for the Strava API and create your application according to the instructions - [Getting Started with the Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/).
- Finally, edit and run the main.py file to start uploading  the activities.
